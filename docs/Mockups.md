## Updated Mockup - Actor-Based Timeline (Aligned with Validated Sequence Diagram)

This mockup implements the 5-column actor-based layout that accurately represents the complete MCP protocol flow as documented in the validated sequence diagram.

[mcp-inspector-actor-based.html](mcp-inspector-actor-based.html)

### Key Improvements:

1. **5-Column Layout**: Host App | Host↔LLM | LLM | Host↔MCP | MCP Server
2. **Separate LLM Column**: Clearly shows LLM is independent and never directly calls MCP
3. **Two LLM Inference Calls**: Visually demonstrates planning (first call) and synthesis (second call)
4. **Communication Lanes**: Explicit lanes between actors showing message flow
5. **Actor Console Logs**: Each actor column shows internal processing and state
6. **Complete Protocol Coverage**: All 13 JSON-RPC messages plus internal operations
7. **Pedagogical Clarity**: Architecture separation teaches MCP communication patterns
